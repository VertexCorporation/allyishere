      <!-- INTRO & ALPHA NOTICE -->
      <section class="policy-section">
        <p>
          Welcome to Ally. The Ally application, the Ally Ring firmware, and related services (collectively, the
          "Service") are provided by the independent development team known as Vertex ("we," "us," or "our").
          These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of Ally.
        </p>

        <!-- ALPHA NOTICE BOX -->
        <div class="alpha-notice">
          <strong>Alpha Phase Notice</strong>
          <p> Ally is currently in an active Alpha development phase. The Service is provided "as is" and may contain
            bugs, errors, or incomplete features. By using Ally during this phase, you acknowledge that data accuracy
            (such as step counts or heart rate) may fluctuate as we refine our algorithms. </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          These Terms supplement the general Vertex Terms of Service. By creating an account or using our Service, you
          agree to be bound by these Terms and the Ally Privacy Policy.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- SECTION 1: MEDICAL DISCLAIMER (EN ÖNEMLİ KISIM) -->
      <section class="policy-section highlight-section">
        <div class="disclaimer-box" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <strong>1. ABSOLUTELY NO MEDICAL ADVICE</strong>
          <p>
            Ally is NOT a medical device, and Vertex is NOT a healthcare provider.
            The Service, including all data, AI analysis, notifications, and "Lifeline" features, is provided for
            general informational and fitness purposes only.
          </p>
          <ul style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0;">
            <li><strong>Do not</strong> use Ally to diagnose, treat, cure, monitor, or prevent any disease or medical
              condition.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not</strong> change your medication, sleep habits, or treatment plan based on data from Ally
              without consulting a qualified physician.</li>
            <li><strong>In an emergency,</strong> call your local emergency services immediately. Never rely on Ally as
              your sole monitoring method.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          By using the Service, you explicitly acknowledge that any health metrics presented (e.g., "Sleep Score",
          "Stress Level") are estimations and should not be treated as clinical facts.
        </p>

      <!-- SECTION 2: ACCOUNT -->
      <section class="policy-section">
        <h2>2. Your Vertex Account</h2>
        <p>
          You must create a unified Vertex Account to use Ally. You are responsible for safeguarding your password and
          for any activities or actions under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use
          of your account.

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Billing:</strong> Subscriptions are processed directly through the app store platform (Google Play
            Store). We do not store your financial data.</li>
          <li><strong>Renewal:</strong> Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled via the app store settings at
            least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
          <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Because our Service is digital, all purchases are final and non-refundable,
            except as required by applicable law or Google Play's refund policies.</li>
          <li><strong>Pricing Changes:</strong> We reserve the right to adjust pricing for future billing cycles with

        <p>
          Ally integrates with hardware sensors (such as the Ally Ring or your phone's sensors). You acknowledge the
          following limitations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Consumer Grade:</strong> These sensors are consumer-grade electronics, not clinical medical
            equipment. Readings can be affected by factors like skin tattoo ink, motion, sweat, or fit.</li>
          <li><strong>Interpretations:</strong> Our AI algorithms attempt to interpret this data, but these are
            mathematical estimates, not biological absolute truths.</li>
          <li><strong>Safety:</strong> If you use the Ally Ring, stop using it immediately if you experience skin
            irritation, redness, or discomfort. Vertex is not liable for skin reactions caused by prolonged wear or
            material allergies.</li>
