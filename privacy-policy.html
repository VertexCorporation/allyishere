      <!-- INTRO & ALPHA NOTICE -->
      <section class="policy-section">
        <p>
          Welcome to Ally. The Ally application and related services ("Service") are provided by the independent
          development team known as Vertex.
          Vertex operates a global ecosystem, with its applications having been accessed by users in over 160 countries worldwide.
          This Privacy Policy explains the
          specific data practices for Ally
          and supplements the general Vertex protocols.
        </p>

        <!-- ALPHA NOTICE BOX -->
        <div class="alpha-notice">
          <strong>Alpha Phase Notice</strong>
          <p> Ally is currently in an active Alpha development phase. Some features
            described in this policy (such as Premium Subscriptions or specific sensor integrations) may not yet be
            available in your region or version. This policy covers the intended data handling for the complete feature
            set. </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          By using Ally, you acknowledge the practices described below. An account created for Ally is a unified
          <strong>Vertex Account</strong>,
          usable across our entire ecosystem of apps and games.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- SECTION 1: HEALTH DATA (LOCAL FIRST) -->
      <section class="policy-section highlight-section">
        <h2>1. The "Local-First" Health Guarantee</h2>
        <p>
          Ally is built on a fundamental belief: <strong>Your health data belongs to you.</strong>
        </p>

        <div class="feature-block">
          <h3>Processing & Storage</h3>
          <p>
            Unlike many health applications, Ally operates on a <strong>Local-First architecture</strong>.
            Your raw biometric data—including pedometer steps, heart rate logs, sleep analysis, and activity
            recognition—is processed
            and stored directly on your device's internal storage.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-block">
          <h3>No Cloud Uploads for Vitals</h3>
          <p>
            Currently, <strong>we do not upload your raw health metrics to our servers.</strong>
            The sensitive data collected by your phone's sensors or the Ally Ring stays in your pocket, not in a cloud
            database.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- SECTION 2: DATA WE COLLECT (SERVER SIDE) -->
      <section class="policy-section">
        <h2>2. Information We Collect (Server-Side)</h2>
        <p>
          While your health data remains local, we collect specific information to manage your account, ensuring the
          stability of the app,
          and providing subscription services (when available).
        </p>

        <h3>A) Vertex Account Information</h3>
        <p>To create your unified account, we collect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Direct Input:</strong> Your username, email address, and a securely hashed password.</li>
          <li><strong>Third-Party Login:</strong> If you use Google Sign-In, we receive your email and profile ID to
            authenticate you. This interaction is governed by the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B) Technical & Device Information (Analytics)</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure our service runs securely and to fix bugs before they affect your health tracking, we or our
          partners (like <strong>Google Firebase</strong> and <strong>Crashlytics</strong>)
          automatically collect technical telemetry.
        </p>
        <p>
           Please review the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a> to understand how these tools handle technical data. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Device model, operating system version, and IP address.</li>
          <li>Crash reports (e.g., "The app froze on the Settings screen").</li>
          <li>Performance metrics (e.g., "App launch time").</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Crucial Distinction:</strong> This data is pseudonymous and is used strictly for technical stability.
          It is <strong>never</strong> linked to your local health database (e.g., we can see <em>that</em> the app
          crashed, but we cannot see <em>what</em> your heart rate was).
        </p>

        <h3>C) Subscription & Payment Data</h3>
        <p>
          If you subscribe to Ally Premium, financial transactions are processed directly by the <strong>Google Play
            Store</strong>.
          We do not collect or store your credit card details. We only receive a transaction ID and validity token to
          activate your premium features. These transactions are subject to the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- SECTION 3: PERMISSIONS -->
      <section class="policy-section">
        <h2>3. Android Permissions & Sensors</h2>
        <p>
          To function as a "Lifeline," Ally requires specific permissions. Granting these permissions allows the app to
          function locally;
          it does not authorize us to upload this data.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Activity Recognition:</strong> Used to detect if you are walking, running, or sleeping.</li>
          <li><strong>Body Sensors:</strong> Used to access heart rate data from the device or connected wearables.</li>
          <li><strong>Notification Access:</strong> Used solely to provide real-time health alerts.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- SECTION 4: FUTURE PROOFING -->
      <section class="policy-section">
        <h2>4. Future Features & Opt-In</h2>
        <p>
          In the future, we may develop advanced tools or cloud backup solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Our Promise:</strong> Should cloud-based health features become available, they will be strictly
          <strong>Opt-In</strong>.
          We will never change the architecture to upload your historical health data without asking for your explicit
          permission first.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- SECTION 5: SECURITY & LIABILITY -->
      <section class="policy-section">
        <h2>5. Security & Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          Vertex integrates with essential third-party services to function, including <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Firebase</a> (for
          authentication/hosting) and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare</a> (for network security).
          We select our partners carefully and implement industry-standard security measures.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, you acknowledge that using services that rely on a chain of providers carries inherent risks.
          While we strive for perfection, we cannot guarantee absolute security against all potential cyber threats.
          The ultimate responsibility for data security within a third-party's platform lies with that provider.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- SECTION 6: RIGHTS -->
      <section class="policy-section">
        <h2>6. Your Rights & Data Control</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> You can clear your health data at any time by clearing the app's storage in
            your phone settings or uninstalling the app. This permanently destroys the local database.</li>
          <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> You have the right to permanently delete your Vertex Account and all
            associated cloud data. You can initiate this process at <a href="https://vertexishere.com/delete-data"
              target="_blank">vertexishere.com/delete-data</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- SECTION 7: CHILDREN -->
      <section class="policy-section">
        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Our services are not directed to or intended for use by individuals under the age of 13.
          We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
        </p>
